## Description

The Hangman Game is an interactive Python script that allows players to guess letters of a secret word. The aim of the game is to guess the word before running out of lives. The script demonstrates the use of classes, methods, user input validation, and game logic in Python.

# Hangman
By working on this project, I learned how to structure to code using classes and methods, handle user input, implement game logic, and apply software design principles.
