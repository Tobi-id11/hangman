## Description

This project is a simple interactive Python script that demonstrates the use of lists, the random module, and user input validation. The aim of the project is to engage in a guessing game where they need to enter a single letter and the program validates the input to provide feedback.

Through this project,I learned how to work lists, the random module, and input validation in Python. It also helped me practice creating conditional statement to check and handle user input.
