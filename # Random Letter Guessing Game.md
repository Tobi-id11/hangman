## Description

This project is a simple interactive python script engages the user in a letter guessing game. The aim of the project is to demonstrate te use of function, user input validation, and checking if a letter is present in a word. The user is prompted to guess a letter, and the program provides feedback on whether the letter is in the randomly chosen secret word.

Through this project, I learned how to structure code using functions, validate user input, and improve code organization for better readability.
